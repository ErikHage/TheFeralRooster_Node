Things are progressing with the brewery, layoffs at my job resulted in a larger workload for me and my team, and my last obstacle race of the year is next week. I started working on a new recipe management Spring Boot app (check the projects page) as a way to learn Thymeleaf templates. I'm planning to finish that up while working on improvements to the brewery website. Below I'm drinking one of our newest brews, a Golden Porter. <br><img class='img-responsive img-rounded center-block' style='max-height: 200px' src='/images/hobbies/drinkingbeer.jpg'>"

I also designed and host the <a href='http://107.170.110.210:32799' target='_blank'>brewery's website</a> (currently under construction). I started brewing back in 2012 when I bought a homebrewing kit on a whim. I'd always been interested in craft beer, but once I started brewing for myself it became a passion. So when my friend Chris (also a homebrewer) asked me if I would be interested in opening a microbrewery, my answer was an emphatic yes! We plan to open mid-end of 2017. <!-- Our flagship beer is called Checks and Balances IPA. We were tired of all those IPAs out there that are 100% bitterness, with no or very little maltiness. Checks and Balances IPA provides the traditional bitterness you would expect of an IPA, yet also has a nice malty finish to balance that out (hence the name). A close comparison would be 21st Amendment's Brew Free or Die IPA. -->"
