      "content" : "I'm proud to be a founding member of the Red White and Brew Beer Company, located in Swedesboro, New Jersey. I also designed and host the <a href='http://theferalrooster.com' target='_blank'>brewery's website</a>. I started brewing back in 2012 when I bought a homebrewing kit. I'd always been interested in craft beer, but once I started brewing for myself it became a passion. So when my friend Chris (also a homebrewer) asked me if I would be interested in opening a microbrewery, my answer was an emphatic yes! Our flagship beer is called Checks and Balances IPA. We were tired of all those IPAs out there that are 100% bitterness, with no or very little maltiness. Checks and Balances IPA provides the traditional bitterness you would expect of an IPA, yet also has a nice malty finish to balance that out (hence the name). A close comparison would be 21st Amendment's Brew Free of Die IPA."
